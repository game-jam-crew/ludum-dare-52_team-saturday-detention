### Display
Vertical Height
768 x 1024

### Issues
- Weird screen/canvas rendering on different monitor sizes. It was a mistake to try to constrain the width of the game for a 48 hour game jam without knowing how to do that. Will have to look into the concept more later.
- Code got messier as the deadline got closer... oof.
